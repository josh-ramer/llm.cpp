# llm.cpp
Making LLMs from scratch in CPP to build a more fundamental understanding of AI &amp; machines a la Karpathy. Things I plan to focus on:

### Produce Code & Write
   - Focus on producing lots of code.
   - Write interleaved with code in markdown.
   - Produce markdown box & arrow diagrams to explain concepts frequently.
   - Produce DOT diagrams where more detail is needed.
   - Write concise tests that keep results stable.
   - Adapt a popular clang formatting style that you like right away.

### Iterations on CUDA GPU Kernels
   - Detailed descriptions & comparisons between kernels.
   - Not skipping to optimal, but exercising creative problem solving skills through all the intermediate steps.
   - Look at the PTX being generated & get comfortable with it, even write it.
   - Add AMD, Metal, & other accelerators down the road.

### Memory Efficiency & Management
   - What are some of the ways different projects do this & why?

### System Design
   - Rewrite the code numerous times exploring the different design decisions.
   - Static vs Dynamic computation graphs, is this something we need to think about?
   - Can we write declaritive code in something like a DSL (ONNX) & then compile it into something fast?

### Study Framework & Projects
   - Try out lot of different things.
   - Write about the design decisions people have made.
